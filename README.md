This repository contains an exemplary DevOps supported setup for Ethereum smart contract development with Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment.
The core framework is [hardhat](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat).

## Prerequisites

`Node.js` and `npm` are required.  
For development, the following versions were used:
- `Node.js` – v16.7.0
- `npm` – 7.20.3

## Installation

Run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies specified in `package.json` and prepare husky hooks.

## Project Structure

- The standard `package.json` file with several helpful script commands
- `hardhat.config.js` file with prepared settings for dev and prod networks
- `.env` file for custom variables
- `husky` folder containing pre-commit hooks configuration
- `abi` folder containing the smart contract ABIs after compilation
- `docs` folder containing the documentation derived from NatSpec annotations in smart contracts
- Several configuration files for additional developers tools

### Excerpt of Important Tools

- [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky): Modern native git hooks (used to setup pre-commit tasks)
- [hardhat-abi-exporter](https://hardhat.org/plugins/hardhat-abi-exporter.html): Exports generated ABIs on compilation
- [hardhat-contract-sizer](https://hardhat.org/plugins/hardhat-contract-sizer.html): Outputs Solidity contract sizes on compilation
- [hardhat-docgen](https://hardhat.org/plugins/hardhat-docgen.html): Generates documentation from NatSpec comments on compilation
- [hardhat-watcher](https://hardhat.org/plugins/hardhat-watcher.html): Optionally run actions when files change (e.g., auto compile)
- [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither): Static analysis framework used to inspect Solidity smart contracts
- [solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint): A linting utility for Solidity code
- [solidity-coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage): Determines code coverage for Solidity testing
- [trufflehog3](https://github.com/feeltheajf/trufflehog3): A secret scanner that searches through git repositories for secrets
